I recently had a User who requested assistance writing a SQL query to generate a custom report in Stripe Sigma. 
It was evident that the User was new to SQL. I asked the User to provide me the columns of data he was interested 
in exporting to a custom report and after a few iterations I was able to compose a SQL query that generated the 
perfect report he was looking for. Here is the final SQL query. Feel free to use it for your own needs. This SQL 
query generates a report in Stripe Sigma for all of a User's invoices and it includes an additional column that tells 
you whether or not a refund was processed for the invoice as well as an additional column that provides the amount
of the refund for the invoice. Somewhat surprisingly, these columns are not avaialable by default in the Invoices table 
in Stripe Sigma SQL.

~~~
SELECT
ch.id,
ch.created,
ch.description,
ch.amount,
ch.amount_refunded AS amount_refunded,
CASE
WHEN ch.amount_refunded = 0 THEN 'no refund'
WHEN ch.amount <> ch.amount_refunded THEN 'partial refund'
ELSE 'full refund'
END AS refunded_status,
--------
i.id AS invoice_id,
i.subscription_id,
i.number AS invoice_number,
cx.name,
cx.email,
s.plan_id,
pri.nickname
,pr.name AS price_name
--------
FROM
charges ch
--------
LEFT JOIN invoices i ON ch.id = i.charge_id
LEFT JOIN customers cx ON ch.customer_id = cx.id
LEFT JOIN subscriptions s ON i.subscription_id = s.id
LEFT JOIN prices pri ON s.price_id = pri.id
LEFT JOIN products pr ON pri.product_id = pr.id
--------
WHERE
ch.created < date('2022-01-01')
AND ch.status = 'succeeded'
ORDER BY
created DESC
